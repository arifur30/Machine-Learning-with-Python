# 🧠 Building Unsupervised Learning Models – IBM ML with Python (Coursera)

This repository contains my learning notes, code, and hands-on exercises from **Module 4: Building Unsupervised Learning Models** of the **Machine Learning with Python** course by IBM on Coursera.

In this module, I explored how machine learning can discover hidden patterns in data **without labeled outputs** using **unsupervised learning** techniques. I learned about various clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction methods, and how these approaches simplify complex data to improve model performance and interpretation.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- The difference between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning
- Understanding **clustering** and **dimensionality reduction**
- How clustering helps group similar data points without labels
- How reducing dimensions helps simplify and visualize data

### 🔹 Clustering Techniques
- **K-Means Clustering** and how to determine the best k
- **DBSCAN** and **HDBSCAN**: density-based clustering techniques
- **Hierarchical Clustering** (agglomerative and divisive)

### 🔹 Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **t-SNE** (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
