# Linear and Logistic Regression ‚Äì IBM ML with Python (Coursera)

This repository contains my notes, code, and exercises for the **Linear and Logistic Regression** module from the **Machine Learning with Python** course by IBM on Coursera.

In this module, I learned about two foundational models in supervised machine learning: **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**. These classical techniques are still widely used in real-world applications for both regression and classification problems. I explored their core principles, implementation, limitations, and how they relate to more advanced machine learning models.

## üöÄ What I Learned

### üîπ Core Concepts
- What **regression** means in the context of supervised learning
- How **simple linear regression** models a straight-line relationship between variables
- How **multiple linear regression** extends this to multiple features
- The difference between **linear** and **nonlinear** regression, including **polynomial regression**
- How **logistic regression** works as a classification algorithm despite its name

### üîπ Techniques and Models
- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Nonlinear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary classification)
