# ‚úÖ Evaluating and Validating ML Models ‚Äì IBM ML with Python (Coursera)

This repository contains my code, notes, and hands-on exercises from **Module 5: Evaluating and Validating ML Models** of the **Machine Learning with Python** course by IBM on Coursera.

In this module, I learned how to properly evaluate the performance of machine learning models using appropriate **metrics**, **validation techniques**, and **regularization methods**. These techniques are critical for building **robust**, **reliable**, and **generalizable** models that avoid overfitting and data leakage. I also explored the evaluation of unsupervised learning models and how to measure the quality of clusters and dimensionality reduction.

## üöÄ What I Learned

### üîπ Core Concepts
- Importance of **model evaluation** for both classification and regression tasks
- Avoiding **data leakage** and **data snooping**
- Techniques like **train/test split** and **cross-validation** for unbiased evaluation
- Evaluating **unsupervised models** like clustering and dimensionality reduction

### üîπ Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix
- **Regression Metrics**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤
- **Clustering Metrics**: Internal vs. External heuristics, cluster quality assessment
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Retention of information and structure

### üîπ Model Optimization & Regularization
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV`
- **Regularization** techniques:
  - **Ridge Regression (L2)**
  - **Lasso Regression (L1)**
- Interpreting **feature importance** and understanding modeling pitfalls
