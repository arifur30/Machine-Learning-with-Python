# 🧠 Module 6: Final Project – IBM ML with Python (Coursera)

This repository contains my practice project and final assignment from **Module 6: Final Project** of the **Machine Learning with Python** course by IBM on Coursera.

In this module, I applied everything I’ve learned throughout the course to build and optimize classification models using real-world datasets. I completed two projects:

- 🛳️ **Titanic Survival Prediction** – a practice exercise to reinforce pipeline optimization and model comparison.
- 🌧️ **Rainfall Prediction Classifier** – the final AI-graded project to demonstrate end-to-end machine learning workflows.

## 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Practice Project

### 📌 Introduction

This project used the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on various attributes (e.g., age, class, gender). The goal was to build a classification model, optimize it using grid search and cross-validation, and compare the performance of different classifiers.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **Random Forest Classifier** using a pipeline  
- Switch to **Logistic Regression** and compare models  
- Use **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**  
- Interpret and compare performance metrics

## 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier – Final Project

### 📌 Introduction

The final project involved building a machine learning classifier to predict rainfall using historical weather data. I explored and cleaned the dataset, engineered features, constructed a model pipeline, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated results through metrics and visualizations.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **feature engineering** on real-world weather data  
- Build and tune a **classification pipeline** using **GridSearchCV**  
- Evaluate the model with metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**  
- Switch to a different classifier and compare results  
- Visualize and interpret model performance
