# 🤖 Machine Learning with Python – IBM (Coursera)

Welcome to my project repository for the **"Machine Learning with Python"** course offered by **IBM** on **Coursera**. This course is designed to equip learners with job-ready machine learning (ML) skills using Python in just 6 weeks. It covers the foundational concepts of ML, hands-on experience with Python libraries, and real-world projects using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## 📘 Course Overview

Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the field of machine learning, and many job listings consider it a core skill. This course prepares aspiring ML practitioners by providing practical, real-world training with essential Python tools such as **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

You’ll dive into core ML algorithms and workflows, including:
- Linear and logistic regression
- Decision trees, SVM, and KNN
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Bias-variance tradeoff and overfitting prevention

You’ll also build complete machine learning pipelines, explore both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and evaluate your models with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
